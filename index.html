        <h2>about:</h2>
        <div>
        <p> hi! my name is zeinab ghandour! im currently a third year 
            student studying user experience design at the school of information. 
            outside of my studies i am an artist, with a love of various mediums! i have
            been into art since i learned how to old a pencil 
            and it is what inspired me to have a creative career in design. 
        </p>

        <h2>huh:</h2>
        <div>
            <p> I love adding whimsical and dreamy elements to my art and
                find a lot of inspiration from classical paintings, as well 
                as the media I enjoy. Clouds, stars, pastel colors, and such 
                are trademarks of my style. I find it more fun to make a variety 
                of art so I use paints, markers, pencils, digital software (really anything)
                to bring my ideas to life. I like cartoonish art but I also love elements 
                of realism.
