        <h2>about me:</h2>
        <div>
        <p> Hi, I'm Zeinab Ghandour! I'm currently a third year 
            student studying user experinece design at the School of Information. 
            Outside of my studies I'm an artist and I have enjoyed creating things
            for myself and others since I was four years old.
        </p>

        <h2>behind my art:</h2>
        <div>
            <p> I like including "dreamy" elements to my art and
                find a lot of inspiration from classical paintings, as well 
                as the media I enjoy. Clouds and muted/ pastel colors can usually be spotted in my art. 
                I also find it more fun to make a variety 
                of art so I use paints, markers, pencils, digital software (really anything)
                to bring my ideas to life. I like creating cartoonish art but I also love realism so there's a wide range !
