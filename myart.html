        <p> I made this on Halloween in 2020, at the time there was 
            a trend to dress up as a ghost and have a photoshoot and I used that as

        </a>
        <p> This is a drawing I made at age 8 when I really started getting into art.
            It was for an online game's art contest. I drew Gurgle and myself at a disco party, 
            I was the DJ. I used a 12 pack of crayola colored pencils to make this masterpiece.
